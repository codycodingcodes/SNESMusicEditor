If you’re updating from an older version of SNES SPC700 Player to the latest one,
you’d be happy to know that replacing all of its contents do not affect your
personalized settings and playlists! Yep! These stuff are saved in these two files:
 - Your settings are saved in your spcplay.ini file.
 - Your playlist is saved in your spcplay.stk file.
You can also remove these two files mentioned above if you want to start fresh.

If there’s a bug pestering in your app, you might consider open an issue via GitHub:
<https://github.com/dgrfactory/spcplay/issues>

Enjoy, and have fun listening to SNES music!
